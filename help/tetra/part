Usage: PART <[service]|channel> [channel]

Parts a service from a channel (by default the main service). This can be
invoked in one of two ways. The first allows you to join the core service to a
channel and the second allows you to join any arbitrary service to a channel.
The service name is the short name ("{{.Me.Kind}}" instead of "{{.Me.Nick}}".)

This command will fail if the channel does not exist on the network or the
service is not present in the target channel.

Examples:
    PART #opers
    PART chatbot #opers
